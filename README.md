About Me: 
Before I came to Coding Dojo, I was a Realtor and warehouse manager for a grocery store. 

I jumped right into real estate when the market dropped and the thought of having some years great, good, bad, or ugly terrified me and didn't sit well with me. 

I loved my stability and fast growing career as a warehouse manager but always wanted a new challenge or something that I could't stop learning. It got to a point where I was 20 years old, already having back problems from work and an accident which left a mark on my back and unable to continue my position here.

I then put all of my energy into Real Estate joining a luxury real estate team in Calabasas which was really great until I realized something was missing which was my stability so I tried really hard finding something I could do as a career making decent money to pay bills while pursing real estate and found Coding Dojo. It wasn't long before I completely fell in love with programming and decided to put most of my engery into this.

**I'm currently looking to meet others in the industry of software developement, colaborating with other professionals, and working at start up.**
